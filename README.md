# FoundryVTT Module - Rotate Scene

This module, when paired with Monk's Common Display, will rotate the scene a set amount for the common display.
This is useful for in-person play when using a table display. Rather than rotating the full screen and having the mouse movement inverted for the GM, this will only rotate the visual scene.

## Limitations
Interaction with the canvas is inverted.
This module is meant to be used for illustrative scenes, rather than functional ones.

NOTE: At this time, despite this module being compatible with v13, Monk's Common Display, which this module relies on, is not.
